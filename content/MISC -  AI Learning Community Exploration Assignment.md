# AI Learning Community Exploration Assignment

## Introduction: Learning Communities & Mini-Projects

In this course, you will work in learning communities focused on different areas of Azure AI services. These communities will help you:

- Explore AI tools available in Azure.
- Learn from peers working on similar AI applications.
- Develop a small project using out-of-the-box AI services.
- Present your work, explain how the service functions, and demo your application.

### How It Works

1. Choose a broad AI application area that interests you (e.g., Computer Vision, NLP, Generative AI, etc.).
2. In class, find others interested in the same area and form small groups (ideally 3 people).
3. As a group, explore AI services within your area and identify a service you want to use.
4. Build a mini-project using that service and integrate it into an application.
5. Present your project, discuss how the service works, and take questions.

By the end of this assignment, you will:  

✅ Have an Azure account set up.  
✅ Have chosen an AI application area to explore further.  
✅ Be ready to form a team and start exploring specific services within that area.

## Step 1: Set Up Azure for Students

- Sign up for Azure for Students (instructions will be provided).
- Explore the Azure AI Foundry to see available services.
- Review the AZ-900 learning path to understand key AI applications in Azure.
- Take notes on the AI areas that interest you.

## Step 2: Explore AI Application Areas

Choose an AI application area that interests you. Here are the available options:

### Computer Vision

- AI for image recognition, object detection, and document processing.
- Examples: OCR (extracting text from images), face recognition, object classification.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)

- AI for understanding and processing text or speech.
- Examples: Sentiment analysis, chatbots, automatic translation, speech-to-text.

### Document Intelligence & AI Search

- AI for knowledge mining and structured document processing.
- Examples: Automating data extraction from documents, intelligent search tools.

### Generative AI

- AI that creates new content, such as text, images, or code.
- Examples: Using Azure OpenAI’s GPT models for text generation, AI-generated images.

## Step 3: Discussion Post

Write a short discussion post (around 150-250 words) that includes:

1. The AI application area you are interested in (Computer Vision, NLP, Document Intelligence, or Generative AI).
2. Why it interests you – What excites you about this area?
3. Ideas for what you might build – What kind of project could you imagine creating with AI in this area? It doesn’t have to be final—just a few ideas.

Post your response in the discussion forum before class.

## Step 4: In-Class Group Formation

- During class, you will find your learning community based on shared AI interests.
- Within the community, form teams of 2-3 around a specific service.
- Begin discussing which AI service to explore further and potential project ideas.
