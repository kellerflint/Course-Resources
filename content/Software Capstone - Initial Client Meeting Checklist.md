### Checklist: Preparing for the Initial Client Meeting

#### 1. Understand the Project at a High Level

✅ **Read the Proposal Carefully** – Ensure every team member is familiar with the problem the client wants to solve.  
✅ **Identify Unclear Areas** – Highlight anything in the proposal that is vague, broad, or needs more clarification.  
✅ **Research the Problem Space (Briefly)** – If the proposal mentions a specific industry, process, or challenge you’re unfamiliar with, do a quick search to get context.

#### 2. Define Meeting Goals & Agenda

✅ **Assign a Team Lead for the Meeting** – One person should guide the conversation and keep things moving.  
✅ **Plan Team Introductions** – Everyone should be ready to briefly introduce themselves.  
✅ **Draft Key Questions to Ask the Client**, focusing on:
- **Problem & Pain Points** – What specific challenges led them to propose this project?
- **Goals & Priorities** – What’s most important for them to achieve? What would make this project a success?
- **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** – If we had to deliver a first version with only the essentials, what would it include?
- **Existing Processes & Tools** – What are they currently doing? Are there tools they have already tired?
- **Constraints & Limitations** – Do they have any budget, legal, or other constraints that could impact the project?

#### 3. Set Clear Expectations

✅ **Time Commitment** – Be prepared to explain that this is a part-time student project (~5-10 hours per week per person).  
✅ **Feasibility & Scope** – Understand that not everything in the proposal may be possible; be ready to discuss prioritization.  
✅ **Communication Preferences** – Ask how they prefer to stay in touch (email, meetings, Slack, etc.).

#### 4. Logistics & Professionalism

✅ **Confirm Meeting Details** – Ensure time, date, and method (Zoom, in-person, etc.) are set.  
✅ **Prepare to Take Notes** – Assign a notetaker to document key points and action items.  
✅ **Be On Time & Professional** – Arrive punctually and be engaged. Dress appropriately!  
✅ **Have a Plan for Wrapping Up the Meeting** – Summarize key takeaways and next steps before ending.

#### 5. Plan for Post-Meeting Follow-Up

✅ **Debrief as a Team** – Immediately after the meeting, discuss what was learned and adjust plans accordingly.  
✅ **Send a Follow-Up Email** – Recap key discussion points, decisions made, and next steps.  

Remember to CC your instructors on all client communication!
