Your project will allow you to dive deep into a specific area of AI, applying the concepts we'll cover in class to a real-world problem or application.\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to outline your project idea, learning objectives, and plan of action. It's not just a formality - it's a necessary step in ensuring you have a well-thought-out project that is both challenging and achievable within the course timeframe. \n\nAfter submitting your proposal, we'll meet one-on-one to discuss it. This will be your chance to get feedback and make sure you're on the right track before jumping into the project work. Be aware that you may be asked to revise your proposal to ensure it meets the course requirements and sets you up for success.\n\n## Predefined Pathways\n\n I have outlined two possible predefined pathways for your project. These are designed to align with core areas of AI we'll be covering in the course. You're welcome to choose one of these, or propose a custom pathway (more on that option later).\n\n### Machine Learning Data Analytics\n\nIn this pathway, you'll work with real-world datasets to solve problems or make predictions using machine learning techniques. Your project should involve:\n- Finding and preparing a substantial dataset from a reputable source\n- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand your data\n- Applying and comparing at least two different machine learning models (e.g., linear or logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, neural network, etc.)\n- Conducting model evaluation\n- Interpreting the results of your model\n- Addressing real-world considerations like data preprocessing, feature engineering, and handling imbalanced data\n\nExample projects that align with this pathway:\n- Use a dataset of home features (e.g., square footage, number of bedrooms, etc.) to predict house prices. Identify which features are most influential in determining home price.\n- Analyze patient data to predict the likelihood of a specific disease (e.g., diabetes or heart disease). Identify the factors that contribute most to the diagnosis.\n- Use demographic and academic data to predict student performance on standardized tests. Identify what factors most influence student success.\n- Use email content and metadata to classify emails as spam or not spam. Identify what metadata is most often associated with spam.\n\nSuggested Timeline:\n- M5 - Complete initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n- M7 - Complete data preparation and train first model\n- M9 - Implement second model and perform model evaluation and initial analysis\n- Final Presentation - Submit a complete, well-formatted notebook with functional models and clear analysis\n### AI-Driven Application\n\nIn this pathway, you'll develop a functional application that leverages AI as a core component. Your project should involve:\n- Conceptualizing and designing an app that solves a real problem using AI\n- Implementing a minimum viable product (MVP) of your app\n- Integrating at least one generative AI model via API calls\n- Implementing some advanced techniques such as:\n\t- Managing conversation context over multiple interactions\n\t- Implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n\t- Creating a custom knowledge base or vector database\n\t- Utilizing LLM-powered agents for opened-ended or multi-step requests\n\t- Integrating tools or APIs that the LLM can call as needed\n- Addressing practical concerns like prompt engineering and user experience\n- Evaluating the effectiveness and limitations of your app\n\nExample projects that align with this pathway:\n- Create an application where users can upload documents (e.g., research papers, legal documents) and ask questions about them.\n- Develop an AI tutor that adapts to a student's learning style and knowledge level. Maintain data about the user over multiple interactions to track their progress.\n- Build a chatbot for a company that can handle customer queries about products, retrieving information about products and inventory in real-time from a database.\n- Develop a text-based role-playing game where an AI acts as the dungeon master. Use a combination of predefined game rules and generative AI to create dynamic storylines and respond to player actions.\n\nSuggested Timeline:\n- M5 - Complete initial app design and API integration\n- M7 - Implement basic functionality and user interface\n- M9 - Incorporate advanced techniques (such as RAG, context management, etc.). Have a functional MVP\n- Final Presentation - Polished MVP app with advanced features implemented and tested\n\n## Custom Pathway Option\n\nIf you have a specific area of interest not covered by the predefined pathways (such as computer vision, reinforcement learning, natural language processing, AI ethics, etc.), you can propose a custom project. This option is highly flexible but requires more initiative in planning and resource gathering. You may also adapt or adjust one of the predefined pathways if you prefer. \n\nYour chosen pathway must align with the course objectives and focus on understanding or using AI. All projects are required to have a significant technical component (you cannot have a project where the deliverable is just a paper or essay).\n\nFor a custom pathway, you'll need to clearly define your project scope, learning objectives, and the resources you'll use to guide your learning. Your proposal should demonstrate that your project is comparable in depth and complexity to the predefined pathways.\n\n## Proposal Requirements\n\nYour project proposal should include the following elements:\n\n1. Project Title and Chosen Pathway\n2. Project Overview (250-300 words):\n\t- Briefly describe your project and clearly outline its objectives\n\t- Explain why this project is interesting or important\n3. Learning Objectives (3-5 bullet points):\n\t- List specific skills or knowledge you aim to gain through this project. What will get out of doing this?\n4. Project Timeline and Milestones\n\t- You may use the suggested timeline as a starting place but be sure to add any additional information and milestones specific to your project / plan\n5. Potential Challenges\n\t- Identify 2-3 specific difficulties you think you might face with your project and how you might go about addressing those\n\t- Are there any complexities in your data? What challenges do you expect to encounter?\n6. Questions and Clarifications\n\t- List any questions or concerns you'd like to discuss with me about the project before starting\n7. GitHub Repository\n\t- Create a repository for this project on GitHub and share the link here. Your repository can be either public or private. I would suggest setting it to public to help build up your portfolio. If your repository is private, it must be shared with me (add both `kellerflint` and `kellerflint-grc` as contributor to your project ONLY IF your repository is set to private)\n8. Learning Resources (*required for custom projects*)\n\t- List at least 3 specific resources, tutorials, or guides you're planning to use for your self-directed learning\n\t- *This is not required for the predefined pathways as I will have starting resources for you. However if you would like to indicate anything additional you plan to use, feel free to do so.*\n\nProofread your proposal for clarity and coherence and be prepared to present your project plan to me. The proposal review meeting is not a formal presentation, but you should have some idea how you're going to communicate this information to me clearly and concisely during our meeting so I can quickly grasp the details of your project.\n\nI suggest copying the proposal requirements into Claude or GPT along with your draft. Ask for feedback on your proposal to see if there are any areas you have have missed or overlooked and to check for alignment with my requests.\n\nSuggested Prompt for AI Feedback:\n```\nBelow are the requirements for a project proposal on an AI focused Project.\n\n\"\"\"\n(Copy and paste the full proposal assignment instructions here)\n\"\"\"\n\nCheck the following for any areas where my proposal in incomplete, unclear, or does not align with the assignment requirements. Provide clear and specific feedback.\n\n\"\"\"\n(Copy and paste your project proposal here)\n\"\"\"\n```\n\nNot all AI suggestions are useful or relevant, but it can be helpful in identifying aspects you may have overlooked.\n","lastmodified":"2024-10-22T04:06:21.872985952Z","tags":[]},"/AI-For-Devs-Course-Project-Rubric":{"title":"AI For Devs - Course Project Rubric","content":"# Course Project Rubric\n\nTotal Points: 100\n1.

You will use AI tools to help you explore and understand new concepts and skills from your chosen pathway and project work. The goal is for you to develop your own strategies for integrating AI into your learning and technical work, understand where these tools can be used effectively, and recognize their limitations.\n\n## Tasks\n### Identify Learning Objectives \nList 3-5 specific concepts or skills you aim to learn (I suggest pulling these from the pathway topics).\n\n### AI-Assisted Learning Process\nUse generative AI tools to explore these concepts (I would recommend Claude Sonnet or GPT 4o for strong reasoning / code generation but you're welcome to use others if you have access). Pay attention to your interactions, noting particularly effective or ineffective exchanges. You don't need to document every interaction, but keep a few notable examples for your reflection.\n\n### Technical Application\nUse AI to assistant in coding or technical problem-solving tasks related to your pathway or project work. Again, note any particularly useful or challenging experiences.\n\n### Reflection and Analysis\nProvide 3 distinct examples of AI interactions you found notably effective or ineffective in your learning or problem-solving process. Each example should showcase or highlight a different tasks or aspects using AI (I don't want 3 examples that all show using AI to quiz you on a topic for instance, try out and reflect on multiple tasks / approaches).\n\nFor each example:\n- Briefly describe the task or question\n- Include a short excerpt of the AI's response that supports your point\n- Explain why this interaction was particularly effective or ineffective for you\n- Identify any strategies you used or reasons why the AI was well-suited (or not) for this task\n\n### Evaluation and Conclusion\nDiscuss the strengths and limitations of using generative AI for learning as a whole. Describe what you found most effective and useful, what was least effective, and how you plan to use (or not use) AI tools in your future learning and work.\n\n## Deliverable\nSubmit a short reflective essay covering the above points. Your essay should be approximately 600-1200 words (excluding any quoted AI responses).\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\n- Depth of engagement with AI tools for learning\n- Quality of reflection on the AI-assisted learning process\n- Variety and relevance of examples provided\n- Critical analysis of AI's effectiveness as a learning tool\n- Clarity and coherence of the essay\n","lastmodified":"2024-10-22T04:06:21.872985952Z","tags":[]},"/AI-For-Devs-M5":{"title":"AI For Devs - M5","content":"I think I want to do of m5 is\n\n- MSE for Linear Regression.

The API should accept input data and use the regression model (either by returning the result directly or using it to make a decision). Create a simple user interface in React that calls the API.\n\nTry to **ONLY** use AI to write code! Talking to LLMs and getting them to do exactly what you want is a bit of an art and takes time to get used to. Practice communicating and instructing it clearly to get the results you want.\n\n## Setup\nGet GitHub Copilot. Prepare your development environment with necessary libraries.\n\n## Flask Application Development\nCreate a basic Flask application and implement a prediction endpoint that accepts POST requests. Ensure your endpoint can process input data and return predictions.\n\n## React Application Development\nCreate a basic React application (I'd suggest using create-react-app) that collects the necessary model inputs from the user and displays the prediction.\n\n*If you're getting errors connecting to the API it might be CORS.*\n\n## Enhancements\nAdd error handling / input validation.\n\n## Optional Extension\nIf you finish this early, try adding another endpoint that hosts a pre-trained GPT-2 model and predicts words.\n","lastmodified":"2024-10-22T04:06:21.872985952Z","tags":[]},"/AI-For-Devs-MISC-AI-In-Class-EDA":{"title":"AI For Devs MISC - AI In-Class EDA","content":"# EDA and Notebook Practice\n\n## Introduction\n\nAI is fundamentally about data. Why? \n\nBecause at its core, that's what AI systems learn from and operate on.\n\nToday, we'll look into understanding data through a process called Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).\n\nI also want you to get comfortable using AI effectively as a learning tool. Leverage the AI tools to get customized examples that relate directly to your specific tasks. This approach can help you ramp up quickly in new areas without spending hours googling and sifting through generic tutorials.\n\nThink of it as having a friend that you can bounce questions off of. Their knowledge isn't always up to date, and they can make mistakes, but they have a passing familiarity with the subject area and can often point you in the right direction.\n\n## Technical Work\n- Create an account on Kaggle and download the following dataset: [Indicators of Heart Disease (2022 UPDATE) (kaggle.com)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease)\n- Extract the data and find the heart_2022_with_nans.csv file. This is the data we will be working with\n- You can work locally in VS Code or in Google Collab\n- Import pandas and matplotlib\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# and others if you'd like\n```\n- Load and display the first few rows of the dataset\n- List all of the features (columns) in the dataset and total number or records\n- Check for missing values. Show how many missing values are in each column\n- There's more than one way to deal with missing values. Briefly investigate a few of these options. Which do you believe is most appropriate?\n- Apply one of the methods of missing values\n- Pick a few numerical columns and a few categorical columns. For categorical variables, create bar plots showing frequency distributions. For continuous numerical variables, create histograms. For binary variables (yes/no), create pie charts.\n\n## Questions and Discussion\n- What are the limitations of this data? What concerns might we have with it? How might these impact and AI model?\n- What might be the down stream consequences of relying on an AI model trained with this data?\n\n## Submit\n\nAt the end of class, submit your notebook (shared link if Collab, file if VS Code) to the assignment on Canvas.

Much like your work in the capstone, these projects are open ended and likely to include elements we haven't covered deeply in class. You are expected to do some of your own research and make good use of tools and resources (such as google, online tutorials and generative AI) to assist you. Feel free to contact me if you're having trouble figuring out where to start!\n\nThere are several broad categories of project I'd encourage you to choose from:\n1. Statistical Model:\n    - Select a dataset (I'd suggest starting with [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) but you are welcome to look elsewhere) and perform data cleaning and preparation.\n    - Discuss and / or correct any biases that may be present in the data.\n    - Develop a statistical / traditional model to analyze the data.\n    - Create informative metrics and visuals to evaluate the model's performance.\n    - Provide insights into what the model learned from the data.\n    - Present your work in a well-documented notebook that clearly explains your processes and conclusions.\n    - Potential areas to explore: feature selection, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, regularization techniques, handling imbalanced data, and more. You don't need to use all of these, but pick a few techniques to implement in your project.\n2. Reinforcement Learning Task:\n    - Choose a reinforcement learning environment from the gym library (beyond CartPole). [Classic Control](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/), [Box2D](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/box2d/) may be good options or pick another environment that seems interesting to you.\n    - Implement a solution to solve the selected task. Use metrics and visuals to show your model's performance against an agent taking random actions.\n    - Document your work in a notebook that walks through each step of your code and explains your approach to solving the problem.\n    - Discuss the challenges you encountered and the strategies you employed to overcome them.\n    - Analyze the performance of your reinforcement learning agent and provide insights into its learning process.\n3. AI-Powered Application:\n    - Create an application that significantly incorporates an LLM or other AI components using the Langchain framework.\n    - Utilize chains, tools, agents, and / or memory in Langchain to enhance the functionality or interactivity of your application.\n    - Leverage AI to generate comprehensive documentation for your code. Develop a high-quality README file that clearly and concisely explains the components of your project and highlights the areas where AI is utilized.\n    - Demonstrate the practical application and benefits of integrating AI into your project.\n4. Open-Ended Project:\n    - If you have a unique project idea that doesn't fit within the above categories, feel free to propose it.\n    - Discuss your project idea with me to ensure it aligns with the course objectives and requirements.\n\nDeliverables:\n1. Code and Technical Documentation:\n    - Submit your project code either as a well-documented notebook or as a GitHub repository.\n    - For notebooks, include detailed markdown explanations alongside your code.\n    - For GitHub repositories, create a comprehensive README file that serves as the technical documentation for your project.\n    - Collaborate with AI to ensure high-quality documentation that clearly explains your project's purpose, functionality, and implementation details.\n2. Presentation and Slides (5-8 minutes):\n    - During finals week you will present out on your project and what you learned.\n\t- You may include a BRIEF technical demo but the focus should be on presenting and explaining the work you did to a semi-technical audience at a high level. Your classmates and I have some background in AI but not the specifics of the approaches you took or the problem you solved. Keep this audience in mind.\n    - Your presentation should be informative. By the end of it we should have a clear idea of the problem or task you set out to solve, how you went about it and why.\n    - Consider leveraging AI to help generate concise text, good visuals, and review content.\n    - Create visually appealing slides that effectively communicate your project's key points.\n\nI encourage you to leverage AI throughout your final project. Claude Sonnet, GPT-4o and Llama3-70B are likely to be your best options for powerful models that can be accessed for free. Utilize AI to assist with planning your project, code documentation, writing, and slide creation. Effective use of AI can enable you to focus on the core aspects of your project and enhance the quality of your deliverables. Just be mindful of their limitations and always review and validate the generated content to ensure accuracy and relevance.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further guidance, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm looking forward to seeing the projects you create!","lastmodified":"2024-10-22T04:06:21.872985952Z","tags":[]},"/Archive/AI-Spring24/AI-W1-A-Brief-History-of-AI":{"title":"AI - W1 A Brief History of AI","content":"# A Brief History of AI\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://egator.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=172da466-e0a5-48af-986e-b145005637f4\u0026autoplay=false\u0026offerviewer=true\u0026showtitle=true\u0026showbrand=true\u0026captions=false\u0026interactivity=all\" height=\"405\" width=\"720\" style=\"border: 1px solid #464646;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay\" aria-label=\"Panopto Embedded Video Player\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n# Cool Things to Explore (Optional)\n- Great documentary on AlphaGo AI - [AlphaGo - The Movie | Full award-winning documentary (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y) (1 hour 30 minutes)\n- Watson Playing Jeopardy: [Watson and the Jeopardy!

Choose a topic or skill you'd like to learn about that you're not very familiar with. It should be conceptual, not just factual. A few examples might be k-means clustering or another unsupervised learning technique we did not cover in class, a deeper dive into neural network architectures like CNNs, RNNs or Transformers, or any other concepts that may be somewhat challenging and outside of your expertise.\n2. Find an online resource, such as an article or tutorial, that provides a base for learning the topic.\n3. Use an AI language model (recommended: Claude Sonnet for strong reasoning, Gemini for access to internet and more up-to-date knowledge, or another if you have access) to assist in your learning process. When you encounter difficulties, ask the AI to:\n    - Simplify the topic\n    - Explain a concept\n    - Provide an example\n4. Test your understanding by rephrasing the content in your own words and asking the AI to verify the correctness of your understanding.\n5. Confirm your learning by re-reading the original source or finding a new source through a Google search. Ensure that what you learned aligns with your understanding from the AI interactions. \n6. I will often repeat this cycle several times to get deeper engagement with the topic, but only one iteration is required for this assignment.\n\n**Submission Requirements**:\n1. At the top of your submission, provide links to the sources you used during the learning process.\n2. Include at least two back-and-forth interaction with the AI that you found useful or not useful. Copy the prompt you provided and the AI's response for these interactions.\n3. Briefly explain what about the selected interactions were useful or not useful for your learning.\n4. Summarize your overall experience using the AI, addressing the following questions:\n    - How did the learning process go for you?\n    - Did you discover any tricks for effectively using the AI?\n    - Would you use AI for learning in the future?\n5.

Before your timeslot, prepare your development environment:\n\t- Launch Visual Studio Code\n\t- Create a new file called `midterm.js` and add `console.log('Hello, world!');`\n\t- Open the terminal and run `node midterm.js` to ensure everything is up and running. You should see the output `Hello, world!` in your terminal.\n2. Join the meeting a few minutes early in case of any connection or technical issues.\n3. Turn your camera on!\n4. Join my office hours on Zoom at the scheduled time:\n\t- Link: [https://us02web.zoom.us/j/6106963583?pwd=VkFBczBxRUpMN0pHcHVDNGlHWVpndz09](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/6106963583?pwd=VkFBczBxRUpMN0pHcHVDNGlHWVpndz09)\n\t- Meeting ID: 610 696 3583\n\t- Passcode: spaceship\n\n### Grading\n50% of your grade is awarded for showing up at your scheduled time and making a good faith effort to answer questions. The remaining 50% will be based on how far you are able to get in completing a few technical questions.\n\n**The midterm is CLOSED NOTES!** Like a real technical interview, the use of external tools (Google, AI, Notes, etc.) is not permitted.\n\n### Topics Covered\n\n##### JavaScript\n- Assign variables\n- Add, subtract, multiply, and divide variables\n- Use the modulus operator\n- Check for equality\n- Use `for` and `while` loops\n- Write functions that returns values\n- Call functions\n- Create arrays (empty and with starting values)\n- Access elements in an array or string\n- Find the length of an array or string\n- Add and remove items from an array\n- Use `if` `else if` and `else` for conditional logic\n\n##### Flexbox\n- `display`\n- `flex-direction`\n- `flex-wrap`\n- `justify-content`\n- `align-content`\n- `align-items`\n- `gap`\n\n##### Grid\n- `display` \n- `grid-template-columns`\n- `grid-template-rows`\n- `justify-content`\n- `align-content`\n- `align-items`\n- `gap`\n\n##### Web Development\n- Client vs Server\n- Web Requests\n\n### How to Prepare\n1. Ensure you are comfortable with the topics listed above.\n2. Try to do the JavaScript midterm practice questions ([[MISC - 305 Midterm Practice|305 JS Midterm Practice Questions]]) without notes. Questions on the midterm will be similar to these. For the flexbox and grid CSS topics, review / practice with [Flexbox Froggy - A game for learning CSS flexbox](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) and [Grid Garden - A game for learning CSS grid](https://cssgridgarden.com/).\n3. If you have questions or want additional practice, seek support before the midterm:\n\t- Go to the Friday open labs at Auburn Center or work with our tutors (see the [Tutoring Schedule](https://egator.greenriver.edu/courses/2493988/pages/tutoring-schedule?module_item_id=85598895) for details)\n\t- Attend board masters!\n\t- Stop by office hours if you have any questions","lastmodified":"2024-10-22T04:06:21.876985973Z","tags":[]},"/MISC-305-Midterm-Practice":{"title":"MISC - 305 Midterm Practice","content":"# Midterm: JavaScript Technical Interview Practice\n\nThese questions are designed to help prepare you for the [[MISC - 305 Midterm|305 Midterm]].

The studio is planning their next game and wants to use relevant market data to inform their decision. They've approached you with a request to analyze recent video game sales data.\n\n## The Studio's Request\n\u003eWe're trying to decide what our next big game should be. We'd like to look at video game sales data to understand which genres are most relevant and which games in those genres are the most popular. We also need to know what platform we should develop for. Analyze this data and present your findings at our next meeting.\n\n## Your Task\nYou will use SQL to analyze a database of video game sales. Your goal is to provide insights that will help the studio make informed decisions about their next game. This task involves dealing with a large, somewhat ambiguous request. You'll need to break it down into manageable parts and make some assumptions along the way.\n\n## Data\nYou have access to a table named `games` in a SQL database. This table contains information about video games, including their sales figures. You can view the structure of this table using the query `SELECT * FROM games;`.\n\n## Assignment Instructions\n\n### Setup\nCreate a new database and run the following script:\nhttps://github.com/kellerflint/Course-Resources/blob/hugo/content/SQL-Files/VideoGameScript.sql\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Use ONLY SQL commands covered in our class so far! (`SELECT` `AS` `FROM` `WHERE` `GROUP BY` `HAVING` `ORDER BY` `LIMIT`). This ensures peer reviewers can understand your work and tests your ability to solve problems with the tools you’ve learned so far.\n\n### 1. Data Exploration\nBegin by examining the data available to you. First, make sure you are using the correct database.\n\n```sql\nUSE games;\n```\n\nUse the following query to retrieve all records:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM games;\n```\n\nTake note of the columns available and the type of information they contain. This will help you understand what data you have to work with.\n\n### 2. Question Breakdown\nConsider how you can use the available data to answer the studio's request. Break down the main question into specific sub-questions that you can answer with SQL queries. List these sub-questions.\n\n### 3. Identify Ambiguities and Assumptions\nIdentify any ambiguities in these questions. What assumptions do you need to make to proceed with your analysis? For example, how do you define \"relevant\" sales data? List your assumptions and explain your reasoning for any choices you make.\n\n### 4. Write and Execute Queries\nWrite SQL queries to answer the sub-questions you identified in step 2. Do not try to write a single giant query that does everything. Use multiple queries to answer different parts of the request and that clearly show the results. Your queries should:\n- Be clear and readable\n- Include comments explaining your thought process\n- Logically follow from one to the next\n- Support your conclusions\n\nRemember, you should write these queries so that another data analyst could follow your process and reasoning.\n\n### 5. Analysis and Presentation\nBased on the results of your queries, what conclusions can you draw? \n- In a comment, write a few sentences giving your specific findings and recommendations.\n- Write a few clear, concise queries that show only the most essential data and results to support your conclusions. These should be queries you could present to business stakeholders to support your conclusions.\n\nNote: There may not be one perfect answer.

This can include data types for each column and whether a column can have null values. Let's explore these concepts with an example diagram.\n\n### College Courses Diagram\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kellerflint/Class-Intro-SQL/hugo/content/SQL-Files/Images/college_courses_erd.png\"\u003e\n\n\n## Data Types\n\nEach column in a table has a specific data type that dictates the kind of data it can hold to the right of its name. There are many different types but some of the most common are:\n\n- **Strings**: These are sequences of characters like the words in a sentence. In SQL they are referred to as `VARCHAR` (variable character). VARCHARs can be given a maximum number of characters that they can accept in parathesis. A `VARCHAR(255)` could hold 255 characters.\n- **Datetimes**: This type represents dates and times. The keyword is SQL is `DATETIME`.\n- **Integers**: These are whole numbers. The keyword in SQL is `INT`.\n- **Decimals**: These are numbers with a fractional part, such as currency or averages. Decimals are given two parameters, a size and a number of digits that can appear after the decimal point. `DECIMAL(4,2)` could hold 4 total digits with two of those digits appearing after the decimal point. So `DECIMAL(4,2)` could hold any value between -99.99 and 99.99.\n\nA full list of data types can be found here at W3Schools: [SQL Data Types for MySQL, SQL Server, and MS Access (w3schools.com)](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_datatypes.asp)\n\n## Nullability\n\nIn addition to data types, ERDs can indicate whether a column can have a null value. A null value represents the absence of a value. Whether a field can be null or not depends on the business rules and data requirements:\n\n- **Nullable Fields**: These are optional and are marked with a question mark (`?`) after the data type in this diagram.\n- **Non-Nullable Fields**: These are required and have no question mark.\n\nTaking a look at the College Courses Diagram above, you'll notice that each column in the tables has a defined data type. Some fields, like `phone_number` in the `student` table, are marked as nullable (indicated by `varchar(11)?`), meaning it is not mandatory for a record to have this information.\n\n# Practice Questions\n\n5. Suppose we need to record the `office_location` for each `instructor` in the College Courses Diagram. What data type should this column be and should it be allowed to be null? Why?\n6. Imagine we want a `last_accessed` column  in the `enrollment` table that tracks when a student last signed into their class on Canvas. What data type should this column be and should it be allowed to be null? Why?\n\n### Back: [[SQL Analytics M6 - Entity Relationship Diagrams]]","lastmodified":"2024-10-22T04:06:21.880985993Z","tags":[]},"/SQL-Analytics-M6-Entity-Relationship-Diagram-Structure":{"title":"SQL Analytics M6 - Entity Relationship Diagram Structure","content":"\n# Entity Relationship Diagram Structure\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://share.descript.com/embed/waLQmDRkrh3\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\"  style=\"border: 1px solid #464646;\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n\nEntity Relationship Diagrams come in various formats, but they share common elements that help us understand the architecture of a database. As we progress through this course, we will explore different ways to represent ERDs. For now, let's focus on a simple example using an HR database.\n\n### HR Entity Relationship Diagram\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kellerflint/Class-Intro-SQL/hugo/content/SQL-Files/\n\tImages/hr_db_erd.png\"\u003e\n\n*Source:* https://www.sqltutorial.org/sql-sample-database/\n\nThe data here should look familiar, it's the diagram we used for the HR database in the Querying and Analysis assignment.\n## Table Structure\n\nThe following properties are universal for all ERDs:\n- **Tables as Boxes**: Each table in the database is represented as a box.\n- **Rows and Columns**: Inside each box, the rows represent the columns of the table. When diagraming, we don't care about what specific rows of data (e.g. the actual information for each employees). Instead we care about the structure of the tables themselves and how they relate to each other.\n- **Primary Key Notation**: In this ERD, the primary key for each table is indicated with an asterisk (`*`). Not every diagram uses an `*`, but they will always denote the primary key in some way.\n\nTake the `countries` table for example. It is represented as a box in the HR Entity Relationship Diagram.\n- **Columns**: Inside the box, you will find `country_id`, `country_name`, and `region_id`. While they are represented as rows in the diagram, these are actually the columns of the table in the database.\n- **Primary Key**: The `country_id` is the primary key, as denoted by the `*` before it.\n\n# Practice Questions \n\n1. According to the HR Entity Relationship Diagram, what will the columns be for the `countries` table?\n2. Which column is the primary key for the `countries` table?

The lines connecting the tables represent these relationships and are necessary to understand the database's structure. Let's break down how to read these relationships using the HR database ERD from our previous lessons.\n\n### HR Entity Relationship Diagram\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kellerflint/Class-Intro-SQL/hugo/content/SQL-Files/Images/hr_db_erd.png\"\u003e\n\n*Source:* https://www.sqltutorial.org/sql-sample-database/\n## Interpreting Relationships\n\nThe lines between the tables indicate how the entities relate to each other. You will notice different endings on these lines, such as a single straight line or a forked line. These symbols tell us about the type and direction of the relationship.\n### One-to-Many Relationship\n\nConsider the relationship between the `employees` and `jobs` tables in the HR Entity Relationship Diagram:\n- **Single Line**: This represents the \"one\" side of the relationship.\n- **Forked Line**: This symbolizes the \"many\" side of the relationship.\n\nThis is known as \"Crow's Foot Notation\" and is widely used in database diagraming.\n\nWhen we read the diagram:\n- **From Jobs to Employees**: Each job can have many employees. This is because the line ends with a forked symbol at the `employees` table.\n- **From Employees to Jobs**: Each employee has only one job, indicated by the single line ending at the `jobs` table.\n\nThis visualization helps us understand that each employee is associated with one job and each job title can be held by multiple employees.\n\n### Employees-Dependents Example\n\nNow, let's look at the relationship between `employees` and `dependents`. Based on the HR Entity Relationship Diagram, what is the relationship between these two table? Try to find out for yourself before continuing.\n\nTo understand the relationship, do the following:\n1. Look at the `employees` table. The line connecting it to `dependents` ends with a pronged line at the `dependents` table. This indicates that an employee can have many dependents.\n2. Now, examine the `dependents` table. The line connecting it to `employees` ends with a single straight line. This indicates that a dependent can only have one employee.\n\nThis relationships is also suggested by the structure of the table itself. We can see that `dependents` has a column for `employee_id`, suggesting that each dependent can be linked to a single employee.\n\n# Practice Questions\n\n3. What is the relationship between `regions` and `countries`? What steps did you take to determine this from the diagram?\n4. What is the relationship between `departments` and `employees`? What steps did you take to determine this from the diagram?\n\n### Back: [[SQL Analytics M6 - Entity Relationship Diagrams]]","lastmodified":"2024-10-22T04:06:21.880985993Z","tags":[]},"/SQL-Analytics-M7-Create-Tables-and-Manage-Data":{"title":"SQL Analytics M7 - Create Tables and Manage Data","content":"# Create Tables and Manage Data\n\n## CREATE, ALTER, DROP\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://share.descript.com/embed/zJJWNOvV9nr\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n## INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://share.descript.com/embed/3XaKOxT7zkS\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n## Constraints\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://share.descript.com/embed/ZOpC1jZU6tB\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n## Practice Questions\n\n### Part 1 (6 pts)\n\nWrite the CREATE and INSERT statements for the tables below.

Making this decision is based on what information is required to uniquely identify the relationship. For example, the combination of a Student and a Class will always be unique (i.e. a student cannot have multiple enrollments in the same class). When combined, those two separate keys are sufficient to uniquely identify a record in the StudentClass (or you could call it the enrollment) joining table.\n\nThis is what your CREATE statement would look like. You don't add a new ID for the StudentClass. Instead, you declare both the ClassID and StudentID as primary keys (and foreign keys).\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE StudentClass(\n    id INT\n    ClassID INT,\n    StudentID INT,\n    \n    PRIMARY KEY(id),\n    FOREIGN KEY(ClassID) REFERENCES Class(ID),\n    FOREIGN KEY(StudentID) REFERENCES Student(ID)\n);\n```\n\nHowever there are times when the combination of two keys in a table are not enough to create a unique identifier. For example, imagine we had a shopping application where users could make multiple payments on an order to pay it off over time. In that situation, the combination of the UserID and the OrderID would not be enough to establish a unique identifier because we could have multiple payments with the same combination of an order and user made on different dates. Here we would either need to add more fields to our composite primary key to make it unique or instead create a new primary key column rather than use a composite primary key. In the latter case, the OrderID and UserID would remain in the Payments table but only as foreign keys, not primary keys.  \n\nIn that example the code would look like this. We create the new ID field since the OrderID and UserID together still aren't sufficient to uniquely identify the record:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE Payments(\n    ID INT,\n    OrderID INT,\n    UserID INT,\n    AmountPaid DECIMAL(10,2),\n    \n    PRIMARY KEY(ID),\n    FOREIGN KEY(OrderID) REFERENCES Order(ID),\n    FOREIGN KEY(User) REFERENCES User(ID)\n);\n```\n\n### Back: [[SQL Analytics M8 - Many-to-Many Relationships and Entity Relationship Diagrams]]","lastmodified":"2024-10-22T04:06:21.880985993Z","tags":[]},"/SQL-Analytics-M8-Creating-Entity-Relationship-Diagrams":{"title":"SQL Analytics M8 - Creating Entity Relationship Diagrams","content":"\n\n### Back [[SQL Analytics M8 - Many-to-Many Relationships and Entity Relationship Diagrams]]","lastmodified":"2024-10-22T04:06:21.880985993Z","tags":[]},"/SQL-Analytics-M8-Many-to-Many-Relationships":{"title":"SQL Analytics M8 - Many-to-Many Relationships","content":"### Back: [[SQL Analytics M8 - Many-to-Many Relationships and Entity Relationship Diagrams]]\n\n# Many-to-Many Relationships\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://egator.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=c5b32412-9c53-4db8-a649-b0fb000ed371\u0026autoplay=false\u0026offerviewer=true\u0026showtitle=true\u0026showbrand=true\u0026captions=false\u0026interactivity=all\" height=\"405\" width=\"720\" style=\"border: 1px solid #464646;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay\" aria-label=\"Panopto Embedded Video Player\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n## Introduction to Many-to-Many Relationships\n\nA many-to-many relationship in databases occurs when multiple records in one table are associated with multiple records in another table. This kind of relationship often requires a third table, known as a junction, associative or joining table (depending on who you ask). For this class, I will use the term joining table. The joining table is used to break a many-to-many relationship down into two one-to-many relationships.\n\nLet's explore this concept with a new set of tables for books and authors that represent a many-to-many relationship.\n\n### Authors Table:\n|AuthorID|AuthorName|\n|---|---|\n|1|Luna Bellatrix|\n|2|Orion Stardust|\n|3|Celeste Moon |\n### Books Table:\n|BookID|Title|\n|---|---|\n|101|Whispers of the Galaxy|\n|102|Secrets of the Eclipse|\n|103|Shadows in the Cosmos|\n|104|Starlight Symphony|\n|105|Moonlit Myth|\n### BooksAuthors Joining Table:\n|BookID|AuthorID|\n|---|---|\n|101|1|\n|102|2|\n|103|2|\n|103|1|\n|104|3|\n|105|3|\n\nIn the `BooksAuthors` table, both `BookID` and `AuthorID` are used together to create unique combinations, allowing for the representation of multiple authors per book and vice versa.\n\n### Understanding the many-to-many Relationship\n\n1. **First One-to-Many**: Each record in the `Authors` table can be linked to multiple records in the `BooksAuthors` table. For example, AuthorID 2 is linked to BookID 102 and 103. This is a one-to-many relationship from Authors to BooksAuthors.\n\n2. **Second One-to-Many**: Similarly, each record in the `Books` table can be linked to multiple records in the `BooksAuthors` table. For instance, BookID 103 is linked to AuthorID 1 and 2. This is another one-to-many relationship, but from Books to BooksAuthors.\n\n3. **The Many-to-Many**: These two one-to-many relationships combine to form a many-to-many relationship. An author can write multiple books, and a book can be written by multiple authors. The `BooksAuthors` table serves as a bridge, linking each book to one or more authors and each author to one or more books.\n\n### Back: [[SQL Analytics M8 - Many-to-Many Relationships and Entity Relationship Diagrams]]","lastmodified":"2024-10-22T04:06:21.880985993Z","tags":[]},"/SQL-Analytics-M8-Many-to-Many-Relationships-and-Entity-Relationship-Diagrams":{"title":"SQL Analytics M8 - Many-to-Many Relationships and Entity Relationship Diagrams","content":"# Many-to-Many Relationships and Entity Relationship Diagrams\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://share.descript.com/embed/4atZ5UxCvkD\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n### [[SQL Analytics M8 - Many-to-Many Relationships|Many-to-Many Relationships]] (~10 min)\n\n### [[SQL Analytics M8 - Table Aliasing|Table Aliasing]] (~3 min)\n\n## Creating Entity Relationship Diagrams\n\n### One-to-Many ER Diagrams \n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://egator.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=d43d459b-9a76-48bf-bb0d-b11c015d3d30\u0026autoplay=false\u0026offerviewer=true\u0026showtitle=true\u0026showbrand=true\u0026captions=false\u0026interactivity=all\" height=\"405\" width=\"720\" style=\"border: 1px solid #464646;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay\" aria-label=\"Panopto Embedded Video Player\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n### Many-to-Many ER Diagrams\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://egator.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=b488333a-81d2-4859-9854-b11c015d3061\u0026autoplay=false\u0026offerviewer=true\u0026showtitle=true\u0026showbrand=true\u0026captions=false\u0026interactivity=all\" height=\"405\" width=\"720\" style=\"border: 1px solid #464646;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay\" aria-label=\"Panopto Embedded Video Player\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n### [[SQL Analytics M8 - Composite Primary Keys]] (~6 min)\n\n\n# Creating Entity Relationship Diagrams\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://egator.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=99ed404e-6872-496d-95da-b11c015d3030\u0026autoplay=false\u0026offerviewer=true\u0026showtitle=true\u0026showbrand=true\u0026captions=false\u0026interactivity=all\" height=\"405\" width=\"720\" style=\"border: 1px solid #464646;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay\" aria-label=\"Panopto Embedded Video Player\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n### Link to the diagraming tool -\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://drawsql.app\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edrawSQL\u003c/a\u003e (https://drawsql.app)\n\n\n## Practice Questions\n\nCreate an entity relationship diagram for the following questions using [drawSQL](https://drawsql.app/). *Please check with your instructor and get permission before using any other tool.*\n\n1. *(4pts)* Create an entity relationship diagram to represent the tables created in the script below.\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kellerflint/Class-Intro-SQL/hugo/content/SQL-Files/Images/book_store_script_img.png\"\u003e\n\n2.

They need a database to help them track information about their stands, shipments and employees. Requirements:\n\t- Each lemonade stand has a street address and a target revenue.\n\t- Lemonade stands can receive many shipments, but a shipment can only go to one lemonade stand. The database should track which shipment is sent to which stand.\n\t- Shipments must always have the date that they were sent. A shipment may also have the date that they were received but this value might be empty if a shipment has not reached the stand yet.\n\t- Each shipment can contain many different supply items (such as lemons, water, napkins, etc.) and a supply item can belong to many shipments. The database should also track how many of each supply item was sent in a shipment.\n\t- Each supply item has a name and a price.\n\t- Lemonade stands can have many employees but an employee can only work at one stand at a time.\n\t- Each employee has a first name, a last name and an age. The database should also track which day of the week (M, Tu, W, Th, F, Sat, or Sun) that they work. Employees are only scheduled to work once each week.\n\n***Representing this scenario should require 5 tables.

This temporary name (aka alias) is often an abbreviation of the full table name. This is particularly useful in queries involving multiple tables because it simplifies the query syntax and makes it easier to read and write.\n\n### Example Using Authors and Books\n\nLet's look at the Authors and Books tables to see how table aliasing can be applied.\n### Authors Table\n|AuthorID|AuthorName|\n|---|---|\n|1|J.K. Rowling|\n|2|George Orwell|\n|3|Leo Tolstoy|\n### Books Table\n|BookID|Title|AuthorID|\n|---|---|---|\n|101|Harry Potter|1|\n|102|1984|2|\n|103|Animal Farm|2|\n|104|War and Peace|3|\n|105|Anna Karenina|3|\n\nHere's how we might perform a join to get the Titles and Authors using aliasing:\n\n```sql\nSELECT b.Title, a.AuthorName FROM Books b\nJOIN Authors a ON b.AuthorID = a.AuthorID;\n```\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`Books b`**: Here, `Books` is aliased as `b`. This means that in the rest of the query, we can refer to the `Books` table as `b`.\n2. **`Authors a`**: Similarly, `Authors` is aliased as `a`. Any reference to the `Authors` table can now be made using `a`.\n3. **`b.Title, a.AuthorName`**: Instead of writing `Books.Title` and `Authors.AuthorName`, we use the aliases, making the query more concise.\n4. **`b.AuthorID = a.AuthorID`**: The JOIN condition uses the aliases as a stand in for the full table names as well.\n\n### Back: [[SQL Analytics M8 - Many-to-Many Relationships and Entity Relationship Diagrams]]","lastmodified":"2024-10-22T04:06:21.880985993Z","tags":[]},"/SQL-Analytics-M9-Database-Design":{"title":"SQL Analytics M9 - Database Design","content":"# Database Design\n\n## Intro\n\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://share.descript.com/embed/PNTeC55FGFW\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n## Database Design Example\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://egator.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=f7aec8fd-4eb1-4e02-a23f-b12401592fb7\u0026autoplay=false\u0026offerviewer=true\u0026showtitle=true\u0026showbrand=true\u0026captions=false\u0026interactivity=all\" height=\"405\" width=\"720\" style=\"border: 1px solid #464646;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay\" aria-label=\"Panopto Embedded Video Player\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n*Note: I'm using a different diagraming tool in this video but for your assignment use drawSQL (https://drawsql.app) like in previous weeks.*\n\n## Database Design Assignment\n\nFor this assignment, you’ll be going through the entire process of designing, creating and querying a database for a local property management company. This company manages rental properties for landlords in the greater Seattle area for a percentage of the rental income. In order to handle these properties effectively the company needs to organize and track information about their properties and tenants in a database.\n\n**Part 1 (20 pts): Create an Entity Relationship Diagram**. Create an entity relationship diagram that represents the following:\n\n1. Owners have names, phone numbers and a date that they joined the management service.\n2. An owner can have multiple properties managed by the company and a property can have one or more owners.\n3. Properties have a street address and an estimated market value.\n4. Properties have one or more units and a unit can only belong to one property. \n5. Each unit has a unit number and a monthly cost. \n6. A unit can have many tenants, but a tenant can only be in one unit.\n7. Tenants have a first name, last name and email.\n8. A payment has a date and an amount paid. It also must track the user who made the payment and the unit that the payment was made on.\n9. Tenants can make maintenance requests on units. A maintenance request has a description, a severity (1-10) and a completion status (done or not done). It also must track the tenant who made the request and the unit the request was made on.\n\n**Part 2 (10 pts): Create and populate tables**. Write CREATE statements for each table in your diagram. Then insert at least 2 rows of data into every table (although you may want to add more to some of the joining tables). Be sure that the relationships you establish between your tables match the design outlined in your diagram, I'm looking for consistency between your code and your ERD.\n\nAfter your `CREATE` and `INSERT` statements, write a `SELECT * FROM TableName` for each table in your database. Like so:\n```sql\n-- CREATE statements...\n\n-- INSERT statements...\n\nSELECT * FROM Tenants;\nSELECT * FROM Units;\nSELECT * FROM Owners;\n-- and so on for each table ...\n```\n\n# Submission Instructions\n\nFor part 1 of this assignment, take a screenshot of your completed entity relationship diagram(s) from drawSQL.\n\nFor part 2 of this assignment, please put your `CREATE`, `INSERT` and `SELECT` SQL queries into a single SQL file.\n\nUpload the .sql file and ER diagram image to the assignment on Canvas.\n","lastmodified":"2024-10-22T04:06:21.880985993Z","tags":[]},"/SQL-Analytics-M9-Database-Design-Challenge":{"title":"SQL Analytics M9 - Database Design Challenge","content":"# Database Design Assignment - Challenge\n\nFor this challenge, you will be designing and implementing a database to solve a business problem. To give some exposure to the ways you might use your SQL knowledge in industry, this problem will be roughly based on a real-world application I was tasked with designing and implementing during my first software development internship.\n\n**Background**:\n\nEdanava is a multinational digital consulting company. This means that other large companies hire Edanava to create software solutions for them or their customers. Edanava has grown quickly and, at any given time, has thousands of **sales opportunities** to keep track of with the businesses and organizations that are looking to potentially hire Edanava to implement a technical project. A **sales opportunity** is essentially a deal/sale in the making. It’s how the company tracks the early stages and setup of a deal before the contract is signed and work begins.\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nCurrently the company has no software to track these opportunities. Instead, employees on the sales team typically put each new opportunity in a word document. These documents have no enforced structure and can get very messy. Documents are emailed back and forth between different people on the sales teams which means the data can easily become unreliable or out of date as many people might end up with different versions of the same document. There is no centralized way for managers or salespeople to view or search for sales opportunities or see data or analytics about how many opportunities are closed or in progress. There is also no way to keep employees accountable or help remind them to follow up on opportunities that they may have forgotten about.\n\nNaturally, this lack of structure means that a lot of possible business falls through the cracks. In fact, the company has estimated that it is losing out on upwards of $10 million a year in possible revenue just because of opportunities that are being lost or forgotten about.\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\n\nIn order to address this, the company has decided to create a web application that will allow the sales team to track and manage all of these opportunities in one place. The application will allow salespeople to create opportunities and add information about them. Then the application will assign available salespeople to work on the different steps of an opportunity based on their role on the team and send reminders if too much time has passed since the last step was completed. It will also allow managers to see various analytics about existing opportunities.\n\n**Your Role:**\n\nAs the lead backend developer on this new project, you must architect the database that this new application will need.\n\nThe sales team has given you some example documents to use as a reference with the kind of information they’ll need the application to track (see documents below). All of this information is important and will need to be represented in your database with the appropriate relationships.\n[[SQL - Supplemental Materials - Example Opportunity]]\n[[SQL - Supplemental Materials - Opportunity Steps]]\n[[SQL - Supplemental Materials - Sales Team Members]]\n\n**Assignment Instructions:**\n\nDesign the Database: Create an Entity Relationship Diagram that contains all of the fields and relationships that will exist in your database. Make sure that your database is capable of tracking all the information currently held in the example documents without creating any unnecessary redundancy.\n\nThere is some intentional ambiguity in the design requirements. When you’re unsure of a requirement, use your best judgment to come up with what would make the most sense for the scenario. Feel free to reach out or stop by office hours if you have any questions/concerns. I'm looking forward to seeing what you all come up with!\n\n**Hints**:\n\nThere are many possible ways to design this database depending on the decisions and interpretations you make. However, if you find yourself with fewer than 4 tables or more than 8, it's likely your design is either failing to track important data or it's not using tables efficiently. Either of these is an indication that you should step back and re-evaluate your design.\n\nKeep in mind that fewer tables isn't necessarily better if it comes at the cost of losing data or failing to effectively represent a relationship.\n\n### Back: [[SQL Analytics M9 - Database Design]]","lastmodified":"2024-10-22T04:06:21.880985993Z","tags":[]},"/SQL-Analytics-Midterm-Practice-Questions":{"title":"SQL Analytics - Midterm Practice Questions","content":"# Midterm Practice Questions\n\nThe midterm questions will be similar to these.

Focus your efforts on parts 1 and 2 before tackling the data analytics section.*\n\nNorthwind Traders wants to identify the most promising locations for expansion based on current customer purchasing patterns.\n\nUsing the Northwind Traders diagram above, construct a query that gives meaningful insights into customer purchasing behavior across different locations to inform the company's regional expansion decisions. Include at least two calculated or aggregated metrics in your query. Make your the query output is well organized and formatted so it is easy for business stakeholders to understand. Provide a brief explanation of how the query you wrote could inform the expansion strategy.\n\n---\n\n### Part 3 Answer:\n\n*I have no specific answer I have in mind for data analytics questions. I'm looking for functional queries that meet the requirements given in the question and help give meaningful insight into the data. I'm also looking for good reasoning about the kind of conclusions your query can provide and what considerations or assumptions went in to designing your query. Below is one possible solution.*\n\n```sql\nSELECT c.Country, COUNT(*) AS TotalOrders, SUM(od.Quantity * p.Price) AS TotalRevenue FROM Customers c\nJOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID\nJOIN OrderDetails od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID\nJOIN Products p ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID\nGROUP BY c.Country\nORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC;\n```\n\nThis query provides an overview of the total orders and revenue generated from each country that Northwind Traders can use to identify their top performing locations. Looking at both total orders and revenue by region is important because it provides a more comprehensive view of market performance and potential.\n\nTotal orders can indicate the size of size customer base in each region, while revenue reflects the monetary value of those orders. A region with many orders but low revenue may have a large but low-spending customer base, while a region with few orders but high revenue may have a smaller but high-value customer base.","lastmodified":"2024-10-22T04:06:21.876985973Z","tags":[]},"/SQL-Supplemental-Materials-Example-Opportunity":{"title":"SQL - Supplemental Materials - Example Opportunity","content":"\nClient: Walgreens, United States, 200 Wilmot Road Deerfield\n\nOpportunity Name: Appointment Tracking App for Walgreens\n\nEstimated Revenue: 5 million\n\nCreated On: 22-10-19\n\nWorking Notes: “Walgreens needs new software to help customers sign up for and manage appointments at their pharmacy.

With the right operators, you can filter for rows based on any combination of attributes and conditions.\n\nSome of the most commonly used logical operators used in SQL are:\n- `AND`: Returns true if both conditions are true.\n- `OR`: Returns true if at least one of the conditions is true.\n- `NOT`: Negates the condition, returning true if the condition is false.\n- `BETWEEN`: Returns true if a value lies within a specified range.\n- `IN`: Returns true if a value matches any value in a list.\n- `LIKE`: Returns true if a value matches a specified pattern.\n\nExpanding on the `Employees` table from our previous examples:\n\n| EmployeeID | Name | Age | Department |\n| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| 1 | John Doe | 28 | Marketing |\n| 2 | Jane Doe | 32 | HR |\n| 3 | Alex Ray | 45 | IT |\n| 4 | Sara Ali | 30 | Finance |\n| 5 | Mia Chen | 26 | Marketing |\n\nTo find employees over 30 years old in the IT department we could write:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM Employees\nWHERE Age \u003e 30 AND Department = 'IT';\n```\n##### Expected Output:\n|EmployeeID|Name|Age|Department|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|3|Alex Ray|45|IT|\n\nAs 'Alex Ray' is the only employee who matches both criteria.\n\nAlternatively if we wanted to find employees who are either in the 'HR' departments OR over 30 years old we could write:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM Employees\nWHERE Age \u003e 30 OR Department = 'IT';\n```\n##### Expected Output:\n|EmployeeID|Name|Age|Department|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|2|Jane Doe|32|HR|\n|3|Alex Ray|45|IT|\n\nBecause while 'Jane Doe' is not in the 'IT' department, she is older than 30 and only one condition needs to be met.\n\nTo find all employees who are between the ages of 20 and 30 we could write:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM Employees\nWHERE Age BETWEEN 20 AND 30;\n```\n##### Expected Output: \n| EmployeeID | Name | Age | Department |\n| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| 1 | John Doe | 28 | Marketing |\n| 4 | Sara Ali | 30 | Finance |\n| 5 | Mia Chen | 26 | Marketing |\n\nThis time the expected output includes Sara Ali because `BETWEEN` is inclusive meaning we'll also get employees who are equal to the thresholds.\n\nTo find employees who work in either 'Marketing', 'Finance', or 'IT' departments we could write:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM Employees\nWHERE Department IN ('Marketing', 'Finance', 'IT');\n```\n##### Expected Output:\n|EmployeeID|Name|Age|Department|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|1|John Doe|28|Marketing|\n|3|Alex Ray|45|IT|\n|4|Sara Ali|30|Finance|\n|5|Mia Chen|26|Marketing|\n\nThe `LIKE` command is slightly more complicated. It can be used to find values that match a particular pattern a pattern. For example if we wanted to find employees whose names started the letter 'J' we could write:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM Employees\nWHERE Name LIKE 'J%';\n```\n##### Expected Output:\n| EmployeeID | Name | Age | Department |\n| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| 1 | John Doe | 28 | Marketing |\n| 2 | Jane Doe | 32 | HR |\n\nThe `%` symbol after the 'J' is a wildcard that represents zero, one, or multiple characters. So this pattern is looking for Names that start with a 'J' followed by any number of any characters (or none at all).\n\n`Like` can allow you to match any pattern with the right wildcards. See \u003ca href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_wildcards.asp\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSQL Wildcard Characters (w3schools.com)\u003c/a\u003e for more information on Wildcards.\n\n# Practice Questions\n\n4. Write a query to select all customers who are from 'Berlin', 'London', 'Vancouver', 'São Paulo' or 'Madrid'.\n\n5. Write a query to select all customers who are not from 'Germany' and whose contact ages are under 60 years old.\n\n6. Write a query to select all customers whose contact ages are between 25 and 35 and whose contact name starts with an 'Al'.\n\n# Lessons\n- [[SQL - W2 Select and Filter Data - Introduction]]\n- [[SQL - W2 Select and Filter Data - Creating a Database]]\n- [[SQL - W2 Select and Filter Data - Running Scripts]]\n- [[SQL - W2 Select and Filter Data - SELECT Statement]]\n- [[SQL - W2 Select and Filter Data - WHERE Clause and Comparison Operators]]\n- SQL - W2 Select and Filter Data - Logical Operators\n- Next: [[SQL - W2 Select and Filter Data - ORDER BY]]\n- [[SQL - W2 Select and Filter Data - SQL Comments]]\n- [[SQL - W2 Select and Filter Data - Note on Semicolons]]\n- [[SQL - W2 Select and Filter Data - Practice Assignment]]","lastmodified":"2024-10-22T04:06:21.876985973Z","tags":[]},"/SQL-W2-Select-and-Filter-Data-Note-on-Semicolons":{"title":"SQL - W2 Select and Filter Data - Note on Semicolons","content":"# Select and Filter Data - Note on Semicolons\n\n### Why use semicolons?\n\nSo far we've only been executing a single query at a time but we could run more. A single query does not generally require a semicolon. However when you have multiple SQL statements in a script a semicolon is used to separate each statement. This prevents confusion for SQL about where one statement ends and the next begins.\n\nUsing semicolons is considered a best practice even when they are not strictly required and I will be expecting you to use them in your work for this course.\n\n# Lessons\n- [[SQL - W2 Select and Filter Data - Introduction]]\n- [[SQL - W2 Select and Filter Data - Creating a Database]]\n- [[SQL - W2 Select and Filter Data - Running Scripts]]\n- [[SQL - W2 Select and Filter Data - SELECT Statement]]\n- [[SQL - W2 Select and Filter Data - WHERE Clause and Comparison Operators]]\n- [[SQL - W2 Select and Filter Data - Logical Operators]]\n- [[SQL - W2 Select and Filter Data - ORDER BY]]\n- [[SQL - W2 Select and Filter Data - SQL Comments]]\n- SQL - W2 Select and Filter Data - Note on Semicolons\n- Next: [[SQL - W2 Select and Filter Data - Practice Assignment]]","lastmodified":"2024-10-22T04:06:21.876985973Z","tags":[]},"/SQL-W2-Select-and-Filter-Data-ORDER-BY":{"title":"SQL - W2 Select and Filter Data - ORDER BY","content":"# Select and Filter Data - ORDER BY\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://egator.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=1304790b-0894-4c02-90b6-b0f2017793fc\u0026autoplay=false\u0026offerviewer=true\u0026showtitle=true\u0026showbrand=true\u0026captions=false\u0026interactivity=all\" height=\"405\" width=\"720\" style=\"border: 1px solid #464646;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay\" aria-label=\"Panopto Embedded Video Player\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nThe `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the result set of a query by one or more columns. It can sort the data in ascending or descending order. By default, it sorts in ascending order. \n\n`ORDER BY` must come after the WHERE clause. This makes sense if we think about it, we do not want to sort the rows until we've already filtered out the ones we don't want.\n\nUsing the `Employees` table from the previous example:\n\n|EmployeeID|Name|Age|Department|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|1|John Doe|28|Marketing|\n|2|Jane Doe|32|HR|\n|3|Alex Ray|45|IT|\n|4|Sara Ali|30|Finance|\n|5|Mia Chen|26|Marketing|\n\nWe can sort the results by columns such as age with:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM Employees\nORDER BY Age;\n```\n##### Expected Output\n| EmployeeID | Name | Age | Department |\n| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| 5 | Mia Chen | 26 | Marketing |\n| 1 | John Doe | 28 | Marketing |\n| 4 | Sara Ali | 30 | Finance |\n| 2 | Jane Doe | 32 | HR |\n| 3 | Alex Ray | 45 | IT |\n\nIf we instead wrote:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM Employees\nORDER BY Age DESC;\n```\n\nWe would get the same list but sorted from the highest to lowest age.\n\nIt is also possible to `ORDER BY` multiple columns:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM Employees\nORDER BY Department, Age;\n```\n##### Expected Output:\n| EmployeeID | Name | Age | Department |\n| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| 4 | Sara Ali | 30 | Finance |\n| 2 | Jane Doe | 32 | HR |\n| 3 | Alex Ray | 45 | IT |\n| 5 | Mia Chen | 26 | Marketing |\n| 1 | John Doe | 28 | Marketing |\n\nIn this ordered list, employees are sorted by their departments ('Finance', 'HR', 'IT', and 'Marketing'), and within each department, they are sorted by their age from youngest to oldest.\n\n# Practice Questions\n\n7.

We'll do this by running a SQL script. Follow these steps to execute the script on your database:\n\n1. **Open the SQL File**:\n    - Open the script file -\u003e [NorthwindScript (github.com)](https://github.com/kellerflint/Class-Intro-SQL/blob/hugo/content/SQL-Files/NorthwindScript.sql). It contains the commands to create tables and insert data into them.\n2. **Access phpMyAdmin**:\n    - From the WebHostingForStudents Client Area, find your website and click the \"Log in to cPanel\" button.\n    - Once in cPanel, click \"phpMyAdmin\" under the \"Databases\" section.\n3. **Connect to Your Database**:\n    - Make sure you're connected to the database that you want to run the script on. In this case, it will be the database you created for this class. In phpMyAdmin you can select the database by clicking on its name on the left side of the screen.\n4. **Run the Script**:\n    - To run SQL code, click the \"SQL\" tab in the horizontal menu at the top of the screen.\n    - Copy over the entire contents of the SQL script into the editor. \n    - Click the \"Go\" button at the bottom right. This will create the tables defined in the script and populate them with data.\n5. **Verify the Data**:\n    - After running the script, check to ensure that tables are created and data is inserted.

In SQL this data is organized into tables consisting of rows and columns. Each table in a database represents a different entity, such as customers, products, or orders. The rows in the table represent individual records, and the columns represent the attributes of these entities.\n##### Example Table: Customers\n| CustomerID | FirstName | LastName | Email               |\n|------------|-----------|----------|---------------------|\n| 1          | John      | Doe      | johndoe@email.com   |\n| 2          | Jane      | Smith    | janesmith@email.com |\n| 3          | Alex      | Johnson  | alexj@email.com     |\n\n## SELECT Statements\n\nThe `SELECT` statement is used to retrieve data from a database. It allows you to specify exactly which data you want to fetch from a table.\n\n##### Basic SELECT Syntax\n\n```sql\nSELECT column1, column2, ...\nFROM table_name;\n```\n\n##### Selecting Specific Columns\n\nTo retrieve specific columns from a table, list the column names separated by commas. For example the query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT FirstName, LastName\nFROM Customers;\n```\n##### Expected Output:\n| FirstName | LastName |\n| ---- | ---- |\n| John | Doe |\n| Jane | Smith |\n| Alex | Johnson |\n##### Selecting All Columns\n\nTo select all columns from a table, use the asterisk `*` symbol:\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM Customers;\n```\n\nThis query will result in the entire Customers table being displayed.\n\n# Practice Questions\n\n1. Select only the contact's name and age columns from the Customer table.\n\n# Lessons\n- [[SQL - W2 Select and Filter Data - Introduction]]\n- [[SQL - W2 Select and Filter Data - Creating a Database]]\n- [[SQL - W2 Select and Filter Data - Running Scripts]]\n- SQL - W2 Select and Filter Data - SELECT Statement\n- Next: [[SQL - W2 Select and Filter Data - WHERE Clause and Comparison Operators]]\n- [[SQL - W2 Select and Filter Data - Logical Operators]]\n- [[SQL - W2 Select and Filter Data - ORDER BY]]\n- [[SQL - W2 Select and Filter Data - SQL Comments]]\n- [[SQL - W2 Select and Filter Data - Note on Semicolons]]\n- [[SQL - W2 Select and Filter Data - Practice Assignment]]","lastmodified":"2024-10-22T04:06:21.876985973Z","tags":[]},"/SQL-W2-Select-and-Filter-Data-SQL-Comments":{"title":"SQL - W2 Select and Filter Data - SQL Comments","content":"# Select and Filter Data - SQL Comments\n\nComments in SQL are used to explain sections of SQL statements, or to prevent execution of SQL statements.

Don't worry!** We're about to go through it all in detail in the next few lessons. For now, here's a quick overview you can reference back to as needed when working on the practice questions for this section.\n\nThe Magic Store Database contains the records of a store that sells potions, ingredients and enchanted items to witches and wizards across the world. These tables are structured to handle a typical e-commerce scenario, where clients place orders for products, and each order can contain multiple products. The `OrderProduct` table is a joining table that manages the many-to-many relationship between orders and products.\n\n##### 1. `Supplier` Table:\n- `ID`: Unique identifier for each supplier.\n- `Name`: Name of the supplier.\n- `Address`: Physical address of the supplier.\n- `PhoneNumber`: Contact phone number of the supplier.\n##### 2. `Product` Table:\n- `ID`: Unique identifier for each product.\n- `Name`: Name of the product.\n- `Price`: Price of the product.\n##### 3. `Client` Table:\n- `ID`: Unique identifier for each client.\n- `FirstName`: First name of the client.\n- `LastName`: Last name of the client.\n- `AccountCreated`: The date when the client's account was created.\n##### 4. `Order` Table:\n- `ID`: Unique identifier for each order.\n- `OrderedOn`: The date when the order was placed.\n- `ClientID`: Identifies the client who placed the order.\n##### 5. `OrderProduct` Table:\n- `OrderID`: Identifies the order. It is linked to the `Order` table.\n- `ProductID`: Identifies the product. It is linked to the `Product` table.\n- `Quantity`: How many of each product are included in an order.\n\n\n\n\n# Lessons\n- [[SQL - W3 Table JOINs - Introduction]]\n- [[SQL - W3 Table JOINs - DROP Tables]]\n- SQL - W3 Magic Store Database Overview\n- Next: [[SQL - W3 Table JOINs - One-to-Many Relationships]]\n- [[SQL - W3 Table JOINs - JOIN Tables with One-to-Many Relationships]]\n- [[SQL - W3 Table JOINs - Filter and Sort with JOINs]]\n- [[SQL - W3 One-to-Many JOINs - Practice Assignment]]","lastmodified":"2024-10-22T04:06:21.876985973Z","tags":[]},"/SQL-W3-One-to-Many-JOINs-Practice-Assignment":{"title":"SQL - W3 One-to-Many JOINs - Practice Assignment","content":"\n# One-to-Many JOINs - Practice Assignment\n\n5.

It's a powerful command that can permanently delete tables, databases, views, or indexes. For the time being, we're just interested in using it to remove tables.\n\n```sql\nDROP TABLE tableName; -- Where tableName is the name of the table you want to drop\n```\n\nThe `DROP` command is typically used during database cleanup, restructuring, or when you need to remove test tables or obsolete database objects. It's part of the standard housekeeping tasks a database engineer or administrator might perform.\n\nA few important things to keep in mind when using `DROP`:\n- **Irreversible**: The `DROP` command is irreversible, meaning once you execute it, you can't undo the operation or recover the dropped data unless you have a backup.\n- **Use with Caution**: Given its permanent nature, it should be used with caution. Always ensure you have a backup or are absolutely certain you no longer need the data you're removing.\n- **Permissions**: You need appropriate permissions to execute a `DROP` command on database objects. You have these permission on your databases but in the real world you may not.\n\n\n\n# Lessons\n- [[SQL - W3 Table JOINs - Introduction]]\n- SQL - W3 Table JOINs - DROP Tables\n- Next: [[SQL - W3 Magic Store Database Overview]]\n- [[SQL - W3 Table JOINs - One-to-Many Relationships]]\n- [[SQL - W3 Table JOINs - JOIN Tables with One-to-Many Relationships]]\n- [[SQL - W3 Table JOINs - Filter and Sort with JOINs]]\n- [[SQL - W3 One-to-Many JOINs - Practice Assignment]]","lastmodified":"2024-10-22T04:06:21.876985973Z","tags":[]},"/SQL-W3-Table-JOINs-Filter-and-Sort-with-JOINs":{"title":"SQL - W3 Table JOINs - Filter and Sort with JOINs","content":"# Filter and Sort with JOINs\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://egator.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=68a81ea3-08b4-42c1-8467-b0fb000ebe38\u0026autoplay=false\u0026offerviewer=true\u0026showtitle=true\u0026showbrand=true\u0026captions=false\u0026interactivity=all\" height=\"405\" width=\"720\" style=\"border: 1px solid #464646;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay\" aria-label=\"Panopto Embedded Video Player\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n## Using WHERE and ORDER BY with JOINs\n\nWe can still utilize the clauses from previous lessons to filter and sort on joined data. \n\nFor this example, we'll use the `Authors` and `Books` tables with a one-to-many relationship.

Rowling |\n| 2 | George Orwell |\n| 3 | Leo Tolstoy |\n### Books Table:\n|BookID|Title|AuthorID|\n|---|---|---|\n|101|Harry Potter|1|\n|102|1984|2|\n|103|Animal Farm|2|\n|104|War and Peace|3|\n|105|Anna Karenina|3|\n\nIn order to retrieve data that spans across these two tables, we use the SQL JOIN operation. Let's see how we can use the JOIN command to fetch the list of books along with their authors' names.\n\n```sql\nSELECT Books.Title, Authors.AuthorName FROM Books\nJOIN Authors ON Books.AuthorID = Authors.AuthorID; \n```\n##### Expected Output:\n| Title         | AuthorName    |\n| ------------- | ------------- |\n| Harry Potter  | J.K. Rowling  |\n| 1984          | George Orwell |\n| Animal Farm   | George Orwell |\n| War and Peace | Leo Tolstoy   |\n| Anna Karenina | Leo Tolstoy   |\n\nThis query effectively combines data from the `Books` and `Authors` tables by linking books to their respective authors by the AuthorID. The `JOIN` operation, facilitated by the `ON` clause, ensures that each book is matched with its author. The selected columns `Books.Title` and `Authors.AuthorName` are displayed in the resulting output.\n\nTo understand exactly how the SQL JOIN command works in our Authors and Books example, let's break down the query piece by piece.\n#### 1. `SELECT Books.Title, Authors.AuthorName`\n- **Purpose**: This part of the query specifies what data we want to retrieve. Here, we are asking for the `Title` from the `Books` table and the `AuthorName` from the `Authors` table.\n- **Action**: It tells the database to look at these two columns and prepare to output data from them.\n#### 2. `FROM Books`\n- **Purpose**: This clause specifies the table from which to retrieve data, which in this case is the `Books` table.\n- **Action**: It sets the context for the SQL query, indicating that the data will be selected from the `Books` table.\n#### 3. `JOIN Authors`\n- **Purpose**: Indicates that we want to combine rows from our existing table(s) (e.g., the `Books` table in this case) with rows from the `Authors` table.\n- **Action**: It initiates the action to combine data from the two tables based on a related column.\n#### 4. `ON Books.AuthorID = Authors.AuthorID`\n- **Purpose**: This is the condition on which the JOIN will be performed. To function, the JOIN needs to know what column it should use to match records between the two tables. `ON` is used to map this relationship. In this case, we are joining the tables based on the `AuthorID` column, which is common to both tables.\n- **Action**: It matches each row in the `Books` table with the corresponding row in the `Authors` table where the `AuthorID` is the same.\n\n# Practice Questions\n\n1. Write a query to list all orders, including the order ID, the date the order was placed, and the first and last name of the client who placed the order./\n\n2. Write a query to display a list of all products, including their name, price, and the name and address of their supplier.\n\n\n\n# Lessons\n- [[SQL - W3 Table JOINs - Introduction]]\n- [[SQL - W3 Table JOINs - DROP Tables]]\n- [[SQL - W3 Magic Store Database Overview]]\n- [[SQL - W3 Table JOINs - One-to-Many Relationships]]\n- SQL - W3 Table JOINs - JOIN Tables with One-to-Many Relationships\n- Next: [[SQL - W3 Table JOINs - Filter and Sort with JOINs]]\n- [[SQL - W3 One-to-Many JOINs - Practice Assignment]]","lastmodified":"2024-10-22T04:06:21.876985973Z","tags":[]},"/SQL-W3-Table-JOINs-One-to-Many-Relationships":{"title":"SQL - W3 Table JOINs - One-to-Many Relationships","content":"# Introduction to One-to-Many Relationships\n\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://egator.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=b1546239-e7ce-4a5d-9068-b0fb000eabca\u0026autoplay=false\u0026offerviewer=true\u0026showtitle=true\u0026showbrand=true\u0026captions=false\u0026interactivity=all\" height=\"405\" width=\"720\" style=\"border: 1px solid #464646;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay\" aria-label=\"Panopto Embedded Video Player\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://egator.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=b8901214-6404-4e52-9e50-b0fb000ee542\u0026autoplay=false\u0026offerviewer=true\u0026showtitle=true\u0026showbrand=true\u0026captions=false\u0026interactivity=all\" height=\"405\" width=\"720\" style=\"border: 1px solid #464646;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay\" aria-label=\"Panopto Embedded Video Player\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n## What is a One-to-Many Relationship?\n\nIn relational databases, a one-to-many relationship is the most fundamental type of relationship. This relationship exists when a record in one table can be associated with multiple records in another table.\n\nFor example, consider a database of a bookstore. Here, we have two tables: `Authors` and `Books`. An author can write multiple books, but each book is written by only one author. This is a classic one-to-many relationship.\n\n### Authors Table:\n|AuthorID|AuthorName|\n|---|---|\n|1|J.K. Rowling|\n|2|George Orwell|\n|3|Leo Tolstoy|\n### Books Table:\n|BookID|Title|AuthorID|\n|---|---|---|\n|101|Harry Potter|1|\n|102|1984|2|\n|103|Animal Farm|2|\n|104|War and Peace|3|\n|105|Anna Karenina|3|\n### Understanding the Direction of the Relationship\n\nIt's important to understand exactly why this is a one-to-many relationship. Why can we can have many books per author but only one author per book? The structure of the table tells us this is how the relationship must work. Here's how:\n\n- **Single Author, Multiple Books**: Each author in the `Authors` table can write multiple books. An author's ID can appear in many rows in the `Books` table. For instance, if \"George Orwell\" writes two books, his ID appears next to each of those books in the `Books` table. Therefore an author can have many books.\n\n- **Single Book, Single Author**: Conversely, each book in the `Books` table is associated with only one author. For each row in the `Books` table, there is only a place for one AuthorID. For example, \"1984\" can only be associated with one author, George Orwell.\n\n### Terminology: Primary Keys and Foreign Keys\n\n#### Primary Key\n- A primary key is a unique identifier assigned to each record in a table. It ensures that each record can be distinctly identified, meaning no two records can have the same primary key value. This key is essential for maintaining the uniqueness and integrity of the data within the table.\n- In the `Authors` table, `AuthorID` serves as the primary key. Each author has a unique `AuthorID` that distinguishes it from others.\n- In the `Books` table, the `BookID` serves as the primary key. Each book has a unique `BookID` that distinguishes it from others.\n#### Foreign Key\n- A foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table. Put simply, a foreign key is a reference to the primary key of another table. It establishes a link between tables, showing how records in one table relate to records in another.\n- In the `Books` table, `AuthorID` serves as a foreign key. It references the `AuthorID` from the `Authors` table.\n- This foreign key creates the link between each book and its author, establishing the one-to-many relationship.\n\n# Lessons\n- [[SQL - W3 Table JOINs - Introduction]]\n- [[SQL - W3 Table JOINs - DROP Tables]]\n- [[SQL - W3 Magic Store Database Overview]]\n- SQL - W3 Table JOINs - One-to-Many Relationships\n- Next: [[SQL - W3 Table JOINs - JOIN Tables with One-to-Many Relationships]]\n- [[SQL - W3 Table JOINs - Filter and Sort with JOINs]]\n- [[SQL - W3 One-to-Many JOINs - Practice Assignment]]","lastmodified":"2024-10-22T04:06:21.876985973Z","tags":[]},"/SQL-W4-HR-Database-Overview":{"title":"SQL - W4 HR Database Overview","content":"\n# HR Database Overview\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://egator.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=1bda4f91-4cd6-4dad-b0e3-b10100555862\u0026autoplay=false\u0026offerviewer=true\u0026showtitle=true\u0026showbrand=true\u0026captions=false\u0026interactivity=all\" height=\"405\" width=\"720\" style=\"border: 1px solid #464646;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay\" aria-label=\"Panopto Embedded Video Player\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n## Initialize the HR Database\n\n- DROP the tables from your previous assignment(s), if necessary\n\t- See [[SQL - W3 Table JOINs - DROP Tables]] for a refresher on dropping tables.\n- Run the following script to populate your database -\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/kellerflint/Course-Resources/blob/hugo/content/SQL-Files/HRScript.sql\"\u003eHRScript.sql (github.com)\u003c/a\u003e\n\t- See [[SQL - W2 Select and Filter Data - Running Scripts]] for a refresher on running DB scripts.\n## HR Database Overview\n\nThe HR Database is designed to mirror a typical business's human resources data management system.

Your tasks will involve writing SQL queries to explore the contents of each tables. You will:\n- Retrieve and observe data from single tables.\n- Use WHERE clauses to filter data based on specific conditions.\n- Apply ORDER BY to sort data and make your result sets more readable.\n\n## Section 2: Construct Relational Queries\n\nThis section is designed to make you think about how to retrieve meaningful information from multiple tables to answer a question. You will:\n- Use SELECT statements to gather data across related tables.\n- Employ logical and comparison operators to refine your search criteria.\n- Perform table joins to consolidate data from different sources.\n\n## Section 3: Perform Data Analysis\n\nThis final section of this assignment moves beyond the syntax of SQL and requires you to start thinking like a data analyst. You will:\n- Write queries to answer high-level questions.\n- Analyze query results to identify patterns.\n- Compare and contrast data to draw conclusions using your best judgement.\n\n# Lessons\n- SQL - W4 Querying and Analysis for HR Database Assignment Introduction\n- Next: [[SQL - W4 JOINing Multiple Tables]]\n- [[SQL - W7 Table Aliasing]]\n- [[SQL - W4 HR Database Overview]]\n- [[SQL - W4 Querying and Analysis for HR Database Assignment]]","lastmodified":"2024-10-22T04:06:21.876985973Z","tags":[]},"/SQL-W5-Data-Types-and-Nullability":{"title":"SQL - W5 Data Types and Nullability","content":"# Data Types and Nullability\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://egator.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=adeeea60-d527-4575-b612-b1160003d874\u0026autoplay=false\u0026offerviewer=true\u0026showtitle=true\u0026showbrand=true\u0026captions=false\u0026interactivity=all\" height=\"405\" width=\"720\" style=\"border: 1px solid #464646;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay\" aria-label=\"Panopto Embedded Video Player\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nIn addition to showing basic structure of tables and their relationships, Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) can also give us more insight into the columns. This can include data types for each column and whether a column can have null values. Let's explore these concepts with an example diagram.\n\n### College Courses Diagram\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kellerflint/Class-Intro-SQL/hugo/content/SQL-Files/Images/college_courses_erd.png\"\u003e\n\n\n## Data Types\n\nEach column in a table has a specific data type that dictates the kind of data it can hold to the right of its name. There are many different types but some of the most common are:\n\n- **Strings**: These are sequences of characters like the words in a sentence. In SQL they are referred to as `VARCHAR` (variable character). VARCHARs can be given a maximum number of characters that they can accept in parathesis. A `VARCHAR(255)` could hold 255 characters.\n- **Datetimes**: This type represents dates and times. The keyword is SQL is `DATETIME`.\n- **Integers**: These are whole numbers. The keyword in SQL is `INT`.\n- **Decimals**: These are numbers with a fractional part, such as currency or averages. Decimals are given two parameters, a size and a number of digits that can appear after the decimal point. `DECIMAL(4,2)` could hold 4 total digits with two of those digits appearing after the decimal point. So `DECIMAL(4,2)` could hold any value between -99.99 and 99.99.\n\nA full list of data types can be found here at W3Schools: [SQL Data Types for MySQL, SQL Server, and MS Access (w3schools.com)](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_datatypes.asp)\n\n## Nullability\n\nIn addition to data types, ERDs can indicate whether a column can have a null value. A null value represents the absence of a value. Whether a field can be null or not depends on the business rules and data requirements:\n\n- **Nullable Fields**: These are optional and are marked with a question mark (`?`) after the data type in this diagram.\n- **Non-Nullable Fields**: These are required and have no question mark.\n\nTaking a look at the College Courses Diagram above, you'll notice that each column in the tables has a defined data type. Some fields, like `phone_number` in the `student` table, are marked as nullable (indicated by `varchar(11)?`), meaning it is not mandatory for a record to have this information.\n\n# Practice Questions\n\n5. Suppose we need to record the `office_location` for each `instructor` in the College Courses Diagram. What data type should this column be and should it be allowed to be null? Why?\n6. Imagine we want a `last_accessed` column  in the `enrollment` table that tracks when a student last signed into their class on Canvas. What data type should this column be and should it be allowed to be null? Why?\n# Lessons\n- [[SQL - W5 Introduction to Entity Relationship Diagrams]]\n- [[SQL - W5 Entity Relationship Diagram Structure]]\n- [[SQL - W5 Representing Relationships]]\n- SQL - W5 Data Types and Nullability\n- **Next**: [[SQL - W5 Querying from ERDs]]\n- [[SQL - W5 Entity Relationship Diagrams Practice Assignment]]","lastmodified":"2024-10-22T04:06:21.876985973Z","tags":[]},"/SQL-W5-Entity-Relationship-Diagram-Structure":{"title":"SQL - W5 Entity Relationship Diagram Structure","content":"# Entity Relationship Diagram Structure\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://egator.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=e3fcaaa2-10b5-48b3-8e8e-b1160003d8d1\u0026autoplay=false\u0026offerviewer=true\u0026showtitle=true\u0026showbrand=true\u0026captions=false\u0026interactivity=all\" height=\"405\" width=\"720\" style=\"border: 1px solid #464646;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay\" aria-label=\"Panopto Embedded Video Player\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nEntity Relationship Diagrams come in various formats, but they share common elements that help us understand the architecture of a database. As we progress through this course, we will explore different ways to represent ERDs. For now, let's focus on a simple example using an HR database.\n\n### HR Entity Relationship Diagram\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kellerflint/Class-Intro-SQL/hugo/content/SQL-Files/\n\tImages/hr_db_erd.png\"\u003e\n\n*Source:* https://www.sqltutorial.org/sql-sample-database/\n\nThe data here should look familiar, it's the diagram we used for the HR database in the Querying and Analysis assignment.\n\n## Table Structure\n\nThe following properties are universal for all ERDs:\n- **Tables as Boxes**: Each table in the database is represented as a box.\n- **Rows and Columns**: Inside each box, the rows represent the columns of the table. When diagraming, we don't care about what specific rows of data (e.g. the actual information for each employees). Instead we care about the structure of the tables themselves and how they relate to each other.\n- **Primary Key Notation**: In this ERD, the primary key for each table is indicated with an asterisk (`*`). Not every diagram uses an `*`, but they will always denote the primary key in some way.\n\nTake the `countries` table for example. It is represented as a box in the HR Entity Relationship Diagram.\n- **Columns**: Inside the box, you will find `country_id`, `country_name`, and `region_id`. While they are represented as rows in the diagram, these are actually the columns of the table in the database.\n- **Primary Key**: The `country_id` is the primary key, as denoted by the `*` before it.\n\n# Practice Questions \n\n1. According to the HR Entity Relationship Diagram, what will the columns be for the `countries` table?\n2. Which column is the primary key for the `countries` table? How is the primary key shown in this diagram?\n# Lessons\n- [[SQL - W5 Introduction to Entity Relationship Diagrams]]\n- SQL - W5 Entity Relationship Diagram Structure\n- **Next**: [[SQL - W5 Representing Relationships]]\n- [[SQL - W5 Data Types and Nullability]]\n- [[SQL - W5 Querying from ERDs]]\n- [[SQL - W5 Entity Relationship Diagrams Practice Assignment]]","lastmodified":"2024-10-22T04:06:21.876985973Z","tags":[]},"/SQL-W5-Entity-Relationship-Diagrams-Practice-Assignment":{"title":"SQL - W5 Entity Relationship Diagrams Practice Assignment","content":"# Entity Relationship Diagrams Practice Assignment\n\nIn addition to the practice problems from the lesson pages, write queries to do the following:\n\n9.

These symbols tell us about the type and direction of the relationship.\n### One-to-Many Relationship\n\nConsider the relationship between the `employees` and `jobs` tables in the HR Entity Relationship Diagram:\n- **Single Line**: This represents the \"one\" side of the relationship.\n- **Forked Line**: This symbolizes the \"many\" side of the relationship.\n\nThis is known as \"Crow's Foot Notation\" and is widely used in database diagraming.\n\nWhen we read the diagram:\n- **From Jobs to Employees**: Each job can have many employees. This is because the line ends with a forked symbol at the `employees` table.\n- **From Employees to Jobs**: Each employee has only one job, indicated by the single line ending at the `jobs` table.\n\nThis visualization helps us understand that each employee is associated with one job and each job title can be held by multiple employees.\n\n### Employees-Dependents Example\n\nNow, let's look at the relationship between `employees` and `dependents`. Based on the HR Entity Relationship Diagram, what is the relationship between these two table? Try to find out for yourself before continuing.\n\nTo understand the relationship, do the following:\n1. Look at the `employees` table. The line connecting it to `dependents` ends with a pronged line at the `dependents` table. This indicates that an employee can have many dependents.\n2. Now, examine the `dependents` table. The line connecting it to `employees` ends with a single straight line. This indicates that a dependent can only have one employee.\n\nThis relationships is also suggested by the structure of the table itself. We can see that `dependents` has a column for `employee_id`, suggesting that each dependent can be linked to a single employee.\n\n# Practice Questions\n\n3. What is the relationship between `regions` and `countries`? What steps did you take to determine this from the diagram?\n4. What is the relationship between `departments` and `employees`?

Let's see how we can use the JOIN command to fetch the list of books along with their authors' names now that we're representing the data with a many-to-many relationship.\n\n### Understanding the Many to Many Relationship\n\n```sql\nSELECT Books.Title, Authors.AuthorName FROM Books\nJOIN BooksAuthors ON Books.BookID = BooksAuthors.BookID\nJOIN Authors ON BooksAuthors.AuthorID = Authors.AuthorID;\n```\n##### Expected Output:\n|Title|AuthorName|\n|---|---|\n|Whispers of the Galaxy|Luna Bellatrix|\n|Secrets of the Eclipse|Orion Stardust|\n|Shadows in the Cosmos|Orion Stardust|\n|Shadows in the Cosmos|Luna Bellatrix|\n|Starlight Symphony|Celeste Moon |\n|Moonlit Myth|Celeste Moon |\n#### 1. `SELECT Books.Title, Authors.AuthorName FROM Books`\n- This command retrieves the `Title` from the `Books` table and the `AuthorName` from the `Authors` table to display book titles alongside their authors' names.\n- It also sets `Books` as the table from which the query starts, establishing the context for the JOIN operations that follow.\n\n#### 2. `JOIN BooksAuthors ON Books.BookID = BooksAuthors.BookID`\n- The first JOIN operation. It joins the `Books` table with the `BooksAuthors` joining table, based on the `BookID`. This operation matches each book with its corresponding entries in the `BooksAuthors` table.\n\n#### 3. `JOIN Authors ON BooksAuthors.AuthorID = Authors.AuthorID`\n- The second JOIN operation. It joins the intermediate result (which includes the information from `Books` and `BooksAuthors`) with the `Authors` table. The join is based on the `AuthorID`, linking each entry in the BooksAuthors table with its respective author.\n\n# Practice Questions\n\n**Use the Magic Store Database ([[SQL - W3 Magic Store Database Overview]]) to complete the practice questions for week.**\n\n1. **Display Order Details with Product Names:** Write a query to display details of each order, including the order ID, the date it was placed, and the names of the products in the order.\n\n# Lessons\n- [[SQL - W7 Many-to-Many Relationships]]\n- SQL - W7 JOIN Tables with Many-to-Many Relationships\n- Next: [[SQL - W7 Table Aliasing]]\n- [[SQL - W7 Practice Assignment]]\n","lastmodified":"2024-10-22T04:06:21.876985973Z","tags":[]},"/SQL-W7-Many-to-Many-Relationships":{"title":"SQL - W7 Many-to-Many Relationships","content":"# Many-to-Many Relationships\n\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://egator.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=c5b32412-9c53-4db8-a649-b0fb000ed371\u0026autoplay=false\u0026offerviewer=true\u0026showtitle=true\u0026showbrand=true\u0026captions=false\u0026interactivity=all\" height=\"405\" width=\"720\" style=\"border: 1px solid #464646;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay\" aria-label=\"Panopto Embedded Video Player\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n## Introduction to Many-to-Many Relationships\n\nA many-to-many relationship in databases occurs when multiple records in one table are associated with multiple records in another table. This kind of relationship often requires a third table, known as a junction, associative or joining table (depending on who you ask). For this class, I will use the term joining table. The joining table is used to break a many-to-many relationship down into two one-to-many relationships.\n\nLet's explore this concept with a new set of tables for books and authors that represent a many-to-many relationship.\n\n### Authors Table:\n|AuthorID|AuthorName|\n|---|---|\n|1|Luna Bellatrix|\n|2|Orion Stardust|\n|3|Celeste Moon |\n### Books Table:\n|BookID|Title|\n|---|---|\n|101|Whispers of the Galaxy|\n|102|Secrets of the Eclipse|\n|103|Shadows in the Cosmos|\n|104|Starlight Symphony|\n|105|Moonlit Myth|\n### BooksAuthors Joining Table:\n|BookID|AuthorID|\n|---|---|\n|101|1|\n|102|2|\n|103|2|\n|103|1|\n|104|3|\n|105|3|\n\nIn the `BooksAuthors` table, both `BookID` and `AuthorID` are used together to create unique combinations, allowing for the representation of multiple authors per book and vice versa.\n\n### Understanding the many-to-many Relationship\n\n1. **First One-to-Many**: Each record in the `Authors` table can be linked to multiple records in the `BooksAuthors` table. For example, AuthorID 2 is linked to BookID 102 and 103. This is a one-to-many relationship from Authors to BooksAuthors.\n\n2. **Second One-to-Many**: Similarly, each record in the `Books` table can be linked to multiple records in the `BooksAuthors` table. For instance, BookID 103 is linked to AuthorID 1 and 2. This is another one-to-many relationship, but from Books to BooksAuthors.\n\n3. **The Many-to-Many**: These two one-to-many relationships combine to form a many-to-many relationship. An author can write multiple books, and a book can be written by multiple authors. The `BooksAuthors` table serves as a bridge, linking each book to one or more authors and each author to one or more books.\n\n# Lessons\n- SQL - W7 Many-to-Many Relationships\n- Next: [[SQL - W7 JOIN Tables with Many-to-Many Relationships]]\n- [[SQL - W7 Table Aliasing]]\n- [[SQL - W7 Practice Assignment]]\n","lastmodified":"2024-10-22T04:06:21.876985973Z","tags":[]},"/SQL-W7-Practice-Assignment":{"title":"SQL - W7 Practice Assignment","content":"\n**Use the Magic Store Database ([[SQL - W3 Magic Store Database Overview]]) to complete the practice questions for week.**\n\nIn addition to the practice problems from the lesson pages, write queries to do the following:\n\n2. **Show Products Ordered by a Client:** Write a query to list all products ordered by the client with the ID of 2.

This temporary name (aka alias) is often an abbreviation of the full table name. This is particularly useful in queries involving multiple tables because it simplifies the query syntax and makes it easier to read and write.\n\n### Example Using Authors and Books\n\nLet's revisit the Authors and Books tables and see how table aliasing can be applied.\n### Authors Table\n|AuthorID|AuthorName|\n|---|---|\n|1|J.K. Rowling|\n|2|George Orwell|\n|3|Leo Tolstoy|\n### Books Table\n|BookID|Title|AuthorID|\n|---|---|---|\n|101|Harry Potter|1|\n|102|1984|2|\n|103|Animal Farm|2|\n|104|War and Peace|3|\n|105|Anna Karenina|3|\n\nHere's how we might perform a join to get the Titles and Authors using aliasing:\n\n```sql\nSELECT b.Title, a.AuthorName FROM Books b\nJOIN Authors a ON b.AuthorID = a.AuthorID;\n```\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`Books b`**: Here, `Books` is aliased as `b`. This means that in the rest of the query, we can refer to the `Books` table as `b`.\n2. **`Authors a`**: Similarly, `Authors` is aliased as `a`. Any reference to the `Authors` table can now be made using `a`.\n3. **`b.Title, a.AuthorName`**: Instead of writing `Books.Title` and `Authors.AuthorName`, we use the aliases, making the query more concise.\n4. **`b.AuthorID = a.AuthorID`**: The JOIN condition uses the aliases as a stand in for the full table names as well.\n\n# Lessons\n- [[SQL - W7 Many-to-Many Relationships]]\n- [[SQL - W7 JOIN Tables with Many-to-Many Relationships]]\n- SQL - W7 Table Aliasing\n- Next: [[SQL - W7 Practice Assignment]]\n","lastmodified":"2024-10-22T04:06:21.880985993Z","tags":[]},"/SQL-W8-Creating-Entity-Relationship-Diagrams-CREATE-Many-to-Many-Tables":{"title":"SQL - W8 Creating Entity Relationship Diagrams - CREATE Many to Many Tables","content":"\n# Practice Questions\n\n2. *(3pts)* Write the CREATE statements for the `pets`, `owners` and `pets_owners` tables in the diagram below. \n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kellerflint/Class-Intro-SQL/hugo/content/SQL-Files/Images/pets_owners_erd.png\"\u003e\n\n# Lessons\n- [[SQL Analytics M8 - Entity Relationship Diagrams]]\n- [[SQL - W8 Creating Entity Relationship Diagrams - CREATE One to Many Tables]]\n- Creating Entity Relationship Diagrams - CREATE Many to Many Tables\n- **Next**: [[SQL Analytics M8 - Composite Primary Keys]]\n- [[SQL Analytics M8 - Creating Entity Relationship Diagrams]]\n- [[SQL - W8 Creating Entity Relationship Diagrams - Practice Assignment]]","lastmodified":"2024-10-22T04:06:21.880985993Z","tags":[]},"/SQL-W8-Creating-Entity-Relationship-Diagrams-CREATE-One-to-Many-Tables":{"title":"SQL - W8 Creating Entity Relationship Diagrams - CREATE One to Many Tables","content":"\n\n# Practice Questions\n\n1. *(2pts)* Write the CREATE statements for the `users` and `posts` tables in the diagram below. \n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kellerflint/Class-Intro-SQL/hugo/content/SQL-Files/Images/users_posts_erd.png\"\u003e\n\n# Lessons\n- [[SQL Analytics M8 - Entity Relationship Diagrams]]\n- Creating Entity Relationship Diagrams - CREATE One to Many Tables\n- **Next**: [[SQL - W8 Creating Entity Relationship Diagrams - CREATE Many to Many Tables]]\n- [[SQL Analytics M8 - Composite Primary Keys]]\n- [[SQL Analytics M8 - Creating Entity Relationship Diagrams]]\n- [[SQL - W8 Creating Entity Relationship Diagrams - Practice Assignment]]","lastmodified":"2024-10-22T04:06:21.880985993Z","tags":[]},"/SQL-W8-Creating-Entity-Relationship-Diagrams-Practice-Assignment":{"title":"SQL - W8 Creating Entity Relationship Diagrams - Practice Assignment","content":"# Creating Entity Relationship Diagrams - Practice Assignment\n\n\n# Lessons\n- [[SQL Analytics M8 - Entity Relationship Diagrams]]\n- [[SQL - W8 Creating Entity Relationship Diagrams - CREATE One to Many Tables]]\n- [[SQL - W8 Creating Entity Relationship Diagrams - CREATE Many to Many Tables]]\n- [[SQL Analytics M8 - Composite Primary Keys]]\n- [[SQL Analytics M8 - Creating Entity Relationship Diagrams]]\n- Creating Entity Relationship Diagrams - Practice Assignment","lastmodified":"2024-10-22T04:06:21.880985993Z","tags":[]},"/SQL-ZCUT-Creating-Tables-in-ERDs":{"title":"SQL - ZCUT Creating Tables in ERDs","content":"# Creating Tables in ERDs\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://egator.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=29da4567-e32d-4981-a177-b1160003ee40\u0026autoplay=false\u0026offerviewer=true\u0026showtitle=true\u0026showbrand=true\u0026captions=false\u0026interactivity=all\" height=\"405\" width=\"720\" style=\"border: 1px solid #464646;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay\" aria-label=\"Panopto Embedded Video Player\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n# Practice questions\n\n### College Courses Diagram\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kellerflint/Class-Intro-SQL/hugo/content/SQL-Files/Images/college_courses_erd.png\"\u003e\n\n2.
